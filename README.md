I want to acknowledge the following people who helped me with Batlez Tweaks:

- imribiy (AMD GPU Tweaks)
- Melody (AMD Tweaks)
- Redwan (Help with Packs)
- ADEX (Ram Optimization)
- tarekifla (Restore and Registry Points)
- Chicho (GUI)
- gryOS (Affinity)
- HoneCTRL (Tweaks)

I take credit for most of these tweaks and for organizing them. However, I recommend YOU create a registry backup and a restore point before using them. 
If you feel unsafe using it, please don't force yourself to. Please note that I am not liable for any damages to your computer or laptop.

Lastly, I would like to address any concerns regarding originality. This is an original work; any resemblance to other works is purely coincidental.

I appreciate your understanding
